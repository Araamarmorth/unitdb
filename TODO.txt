TODO:
    * load the unit index only once (before bootsrapping ng-app)
    * unit details
    * performance
    * turn the filters into a directive and place it on unit compare screen as well
    * ctrl + click on thumb navigates to unit details instead of adding to compare list
    * hotkeys: 
        # focus input
        # go to compare
        # unit details (?) if thumb has focus
    * FAT query or similar functionality
    * unit comparison - reorder (?)

SUGGESTIONS:
    * split buiding column into 2 (factories/other) or make problem of the column being so long less of a nuasance
    * sorting - for building columns
